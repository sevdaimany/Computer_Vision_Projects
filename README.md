# Computer Vision
Some simple computer vision implementations using OpenCV.

## Object Detection
In this project, I build an object detection system. The system consists 
of a face detector and object detector that uses Haar Cascades, a 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Histograms of Oriented Gradients 
(HOG) that predict the faces and objects like cars, clocks, and full 
body.
